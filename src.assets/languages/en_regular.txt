msg1_0=Welcome to Rock Rush!\nUse the arrow keys to move around.\nYour objective is to collect all diamonds\nand reach the exit.\nYou can dig through the dirt\neasily, but don't let the diamonds fall\non your head or you are done for!
msg2_0=Boulders cannot be collected\nno matter how hard you try.\nIn every other aspect they\nact the same as diamonds.\nTry to clear the dirt under those four\nboulders to gain access to the room above.\nTalk to the Ice Blob once you are there!
msg2_1=Boulders can be pushed! You can't push\ndiamonds since you collect them automatically\nwhen moving onto them.\nTry to push the boulder so it falls down,\nbut don't let the one right below me\nfall or you'll be stuck.\nTalk to Jack to the right please.
msg2_3=Did you know that if you stack two boulders\non top of each other the one lying higher\nwill simply roll to the right or left?\nUse this technique to\nopen the passage to the last room.\nSay "Hi!" to Fire Blob from me please.
msg2_2=You want to know a secret? If you hold Z\nand hit a direction key you can "snap" the\ndirt away or grab diamonds from a distance!\nDon't clear any dirt above\nthe boulders and move right\nnext to the diamonds and try to\nsnap it without moving into it.
msg3_3=You know, I never liked bombs.\nThey are too dangerous.\nThey work exactly like boulders\nexcept that they explode\nif dropped from any height.\nThis can of course be\nuseful to clear things\n like this brick wall below.
msg4_0=Now we shall see how well\nyou fare in this examination room.
msg4_3=Congratulations on getting this far!\nKeep going!
msg5_1=Blobs (we are not family!)\nare mindless beings which constantly\nkeep close to any obstacle to their left.\nTheir touch is deadly, though!\nOh, and they explode\nlike bombs if you drop a\n boulder on their heads.\nYes, they have no heads.\nGo figure!
msg6_0=Warning! Bugs ahead!\nThey keep close to what is to\ntheir right.\nThey explode into diamonds!
msg7_3=What I am doing here?\nWell, I'm just here to tell\n you that you should be\nvery careful in this level...
msg10_2=In case you didn't know,\nthis ugly thing below is\namoeba. Usually it grows, but\nthis one seems pretty docile.\nBlobs and Bugs are really\nallergic to it, so much that\nthey explode the second they\ntouch it.\nI wonder if that could be useful?
msg15_0=Attention all personnel!\nMagical wall should not\nbe disturbed, and no boulders\nshould be thrown at it.\nChanging boulders to diamonds\nis illegal!
msg17_3=If you let the amoeba grow too much\nit will turn into boulders.\nIf you somehow manage to block\nits growth it will crystallize\ninto diamonds. Nice, eh?
